# Rate My Setup

Review my current Claude Code setup (CLAUDE.md) and benchmark it.

## Tasks

1. Read the current `CLAUDE.md` file
2. Read the previous benchmark from `.claude/benchmarks/setup-rating.md`
3. Evaluate against Silicon Valley senior/staff engineer standards
4. Score each category (Strengths and Gaps tables)
5. Calculate new overall rating
6. Update the benchmark file with:
   - New rating in "Current Rating" header
   - New row in Rating History table with date and key changes
   - Updated assessment sections
   - Check off any completed roadmap items
7. Report the delta: improved, declined, or unchanged
8. Highlight specific improvements detected since last rating

Be honest and specific about what improved and what still needs work.
